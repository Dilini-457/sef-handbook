# Why do you need to partner with us

Over the past 4 - 5 years of SEF, we have diligently built up a strong community of expat and local Sri Lankan industry
experts and academics. They are committed to the upliftment of the education system in Sri Lanka, where they have
benefited from the curriculum themselves but see the potential it has to offer when their lessons learnt from
international experiences are combined with the right infrastructure, governance and delivery mechanisms.

We have no political affiliations or gains, and we are only driven purely to build the education system in Sri Lanka. We
only seek to work with other organisations and individuals who align with our values and purpose to enable the future
generations of Sri Lanka to thrive.
